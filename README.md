# Youtube_shorts_add-on
Watch YouTube short videos in normal video player on YouTube. Simply paste the video link in the field and click "Go to video".
In case the extension box displays like a vertical rectangle (this might be a browser bug or something else) navigate to the CSS file and remove "display: flex" from the .container styling and you should be good to go.
